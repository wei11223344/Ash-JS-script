Hi thank you for checking out this JS kit. There are a few things you should know.
1. Do not comment your code ex: // that will make the code not able to run on a bookmarklet

Make sure that when you use the onclick feature you should call the function here is an example:
var mybutton = button("Click me", clickfire);
function clickfire() {
    console.log("yay you clicked this!")
}
  If you do not add a clickevent you will get an error message and it wont run.
3. Lastly enjoy! This client offers several things for starters and can help you develop anything web related(even blooket cheats)
